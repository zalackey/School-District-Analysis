# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to eliminate data that would improperly skew test results and averages. This is vital because the data that was compromised have significantly altered the school results, thus resulting in inaccurate education data for important school district decision making. The results are now accurately reflecting school performance. 

## Effects of changes 
- Larger distrct schools had the lowest performances overall
- Less spending per student correlated with higher scores in both reading and math
- Overall, less enrollment correlated with higher scores in both reading and math
- Reading scores were higher than math scores
- Before addressing the issue with the set of scores for Thomas High School, their passing rate and average scores were significantly lower. 

The school district analysis changed when the scores were adjusted to accurately reflect student performance in Thomas High School. The average scores in reading and math increased. The overall passing percentage increase, and the percentages of students passing reading and math increased as well. This worked to keep the school's data aligned with trends seen at all 14 schools.
